# ThirdEye (newVision)

Our Third Eye gives the visually impaired the ability to complete tasks without the help of others or the use of unnecessary tools.

It is a real-time vision detection system using a realsense camera to help visually impaired people to avoid dangerous situations. The system would alarm the user when an object is approaching or the user is about to collide with an object by speaking out the description and distance of the object incoming from the user. The user can also push a button to know what his surrounding objects are.
